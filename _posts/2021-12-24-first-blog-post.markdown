# Hello World!

Hey everyone, this is Andrew. I'm currently the lead developer at [DERISAKYU](https://derisakyu.net/), although I am **not** the lead webdev---so while I acknowledge our website is often out of date, it isn't my fault (blame Derris)! That being said, I can't really promise that this site will be updated any more frequently; I was told that since we're making the switch to GitHub at DERISAKYU, that it'd be worth the effort to go ahead and setup a GitHub pages.

I plan to make a few posts about some of my personal projects, which for now (and potentially, for *ever*) will remain as drafts, so look forward to those (with a responsible level of excitement).
